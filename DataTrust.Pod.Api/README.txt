TODO
- Add Swagger UI
- Add Health checks
- Add logging
- Add metrics
- Add validation (for venue checks) - or should this be in the registry API? => Location + user id lookup that user is registered
- Pod automatic registration to the swarm
-- On app start generate a RSA based cert using endpioint address as issuer
-- POST public key to the central registry endpoint with the shared key and endpoint
-- registry registers pod, stores public key and adds health check / metrics endpoint
-- using that public key the registory can create bearer tokens to access the decode endpoint
